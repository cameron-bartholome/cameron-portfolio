## Overview

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**.

It is being updated to reflect my work and experience as a **Mechanical Design Engineer**, with selected projects, case studies, and supporting material.

The site structure is based on a clean, minimal foundation and is being progressively customized to fit my own content, branding, and direction.

## Current State

> 🚧 **Work in progress**

The site is actively being updated and refined.  
Content, visuals, and structure may change as development continues.

This site is intentionally iterative and will evolve as I deepen my front-end and JavaScript skills.

---

## Focus

- Mechanical design & engineering projects
- CAD models, drawings, and documented outcomes
- Practical build work and prototyping
- Clear visual communication of technical concepts

## Credits

This project was originally forked from the **v4 portfolio** by **Brittany Chiang**:  
https://github.com/bchiang7/v4

The original website is a clean, well-crafted piece of work, and it provided an excellent foundation to build upon.  
Many thanks to Brittany for open-sourcing the project and making it available under the MIT license.

All branding, content, and ongoing modifications are being customized and adapted for my own portfolio.

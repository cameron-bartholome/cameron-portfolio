A personal engineering project focused on the design and build of a high-performance 1:8 scale RC vehicle inspired by the Ford Mustang Eleanor.

The work combines hard-surface modeling, mechanical design, prototyping, and electronics integration, with an emphasis on system packaging, performance, and real-world constraints at scale.

This project is currently under active development.

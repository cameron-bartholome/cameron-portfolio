A personal portfolio website designed to document engineering experience, projects, and ongoing technical exploration in a clear and structured way.

The site is built as a modular, content-driven system using React and Markdown, allowing projects, experience, and ideas to evolve over time. It serves both as a public-facing portfolio and as a long-term framework for organizing work across engineering, software, and fabrication disciplines.

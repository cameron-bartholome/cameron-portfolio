A personal portfolio website built to document engineering experience, projects, and ongoing technical exploration in a clear and structured way.

The site is based on an existing open-source template and has been adapted to fit my own content and workflow. As my front-end skills develop further, the structure and implementation will continue to diverge and evolve. It serves both as a public-facing portfolio and as a long-term framework for organizing work across engineering, software, and fabrication disciplines.

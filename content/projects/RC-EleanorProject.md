A personal engineering project focused on the design and development of a high-performance 1:8 scale RC vehicle inspired by the Ford Mustang Eleanor.

The project combines hard-surface modeling, mechanical design, rapid prototyping, and electronics integration to explore system packaging, drivetrain performance, and control at scale. This work is actively under development.

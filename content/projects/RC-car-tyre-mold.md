An experimental materials and manufacturing project focused on producing custom RC tires using a resin mold and cast polyurethane.

The goal was to develop tires with improved strength and durability compared to standard printed parts, while maintaining sufficient flexibility for high-load RC applications. The project explored mold design, material behavior, and repeatable casting processes.
